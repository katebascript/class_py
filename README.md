This draft provides a robust solution for my assignments.

For Assignment 1, I've created a Smartphone class with AndroidPhone and iPhone as inherited classes. This demonstrates both inheritance (inheriting attributes and methods) and a form of polymorphism through the install_app method, which behaves differently in AndroidPhone and iPhone. The _battery_percent attribute also shows basic encapsulation by being "protected" (indicated by the leading underscore).

For Assignment 2, the Vehicle class serves as a base, and Car, Plane, and Boat each implement their unique move() method. The loop at the end clearly illustrates polymorphismâ€”calling the same move() method on different objects results in different actions.
